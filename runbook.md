## First Line Troubleshooting

### The app is erroring

This is a standard Heroku app, so try all the normal things here (bounce the dynos etc). For localised errors, check the user trying to access the application is actually on a syndication licence.

### People can't see their syndication icons

If syndication icons are not appearing for an idividual user (as opposed to all users) then it is likely this user is not on a licence or has been removed from a licence.
This system has an upstream dependency on Salesforce, so it is worth investigating the user's licence status there too.

If *nobody* can see their icons, then this is a more serious problem and should be pushed to Second Line.

## Second Line Troubleshooting

- You can see the details of a specific contract by calling `GET https://www.ft.com/syndication/contracts/:contract_id` with a valid api key.
- `POST` call to `https://www.ft.com/syndication/contracts/:contract_id/resolve` with a valid api key and a json body which is an array of content ids will return the syndication permissions for each article

### People can't see their syndication icons

If this is a problem for an individual, it is likely to be an issue with their contract (have they been removed by accident?)

If this is a problem for all Syndication users it could be:

* A problem with the front end applications ([n-front-page](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-front-page), [next-article](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-article))
* A problem with o-teaser (which is the Origami component that displays syndication icons)
* A problem with x-teaser (https://github.com/Financial-Times/x-dash)
* A problem with this application
* A problem with Salesforce (all contracts live in Salesforce)
* A problem with [next-syn-list](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syn-list)
