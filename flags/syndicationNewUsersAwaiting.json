  "description": "This flag is used as a way to stagger user opt-ins for the new syndication system. When this flag is on, if a userâ€™s UUID is in the list of awaiting users in config vars, they will see the new syndication system (as opposed to the current, third-party system). Afterwards, their UUID can be moved over to the main list of UUIDs in config vars and this flag can be switched off again. This mechanism makes releasing to new (specific) users much less stressful for devs :-)",
