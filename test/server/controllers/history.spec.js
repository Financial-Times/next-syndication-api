The squeeze on real incomes is continuing.</p>\n<p><img src="http://com.ft.imagepublish.prod.s3.amazonaws.com/128ca93a-6b97-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" width="600"/>\n</p>\n<p>Chris Giles goes through the various <ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article" url="http://api.ft.com/content/bf036874-6b9d-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" title="www.ft.com">explanations</ft-content> for the slowdown in price growth, the most plausible being that June was just a blip before inflation accelerates again.</p>\n<p>While we wait to find out, the Resolution Foundation has put its finger on an important fact that tends to be obscured by the overall inflation numbers published by the Office for National Statistics. This is because different types of households spend their money on different things, they also experience different inflation rates. The Resolution Foundation’s Stephen Clarke <a href="http://www.resolutionfoundation.org/media/blog/inflation-afflictions/" title="www.resolutionfoundation.org">breaks down household spending</a> by categories of expenditure and calculates that the poorest households have faced faster price growth for their typical consumption basket (2 per cent over the first six months of this year) than have the richest households (1.8 per cent).</p>\n<p>This obviously affects the politics of inflation. And this has been a pattern for while. An <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/user-guidance/prices/cpi-and-rpi/variation-in-the-inflation-experience-of-uk-households--2003-2014.pdf" title="www.ons.gov.uk">ONS study</a> of differential inflation experience for different types of households between 2003 and 2014 found that the “price of products purchased by households in the lowest expenditure decile increased on average by 3.7% per year over this period, compared with just 2.3% for the highest-expenditure decile”. Looking at income rather than expenditure yields equivalent conclusions.</p>\n<p>Citing similar evidence that inflation fell more for the rich than for the poor in 2013-14, Clarke suggests that “even if inflation abates . . . it may not provide as much benefit for poorer households . . . This could mean that the current squeeze on living standards is longer and deeper than previously expected for lower income households.”</p>\n<p>There are also clear differences in the <em>variability</em> of experienced inflation between different groups. That is documented in the ONS study for the UK. <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2014/files/201489pap.pdf" title="www.federalreserve.gov">US data</a> also exhibit such differences in volatility, which are found to correlate with different <em>expectations</em> of inflation from different demographic groups — even when, on the whole, those differences are not borne out by actual <a href="https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom%20and%20events/publications/economic%20commentary/2011%20economic%20commentaries/ec%20201107%20demographic%20differences%20in%20inflation%20expectations%20what%20do%20they%20really%20mean" title="www.clevelandfed.org">experienced inflation</a>.</p>\n<p>But expectations of inflation may matter as much as actually experienced inflation. That seems particularly important in countries where squeezed living standards have resulted in strong political insurgencies against the establishment. </p>\n<p>The ONS study includes this tantalising paragraph: “Comparing the [overall consumer prices index] with the inflation outturns for different groups, this paper concludes that the CPI is broadly representative of the price experience of households around two-thirds of the way up the expenditure distribution. An equivalent, ‘democratic’ price index — which weights the inflation experience of households equally, rather than drawing on household sector expenditure weights — is around 0.3 percentage points higher on average than the plutocratic measure over this period.”</p>\n<p>That is quite a distance between officially measured costs of living and how they are experienced by the majority of people. It almost invites an unscrupulous politician to complain about “fake numbers” in a “rigged system”.</p>\n<h3 class="ft-subhead">Other readables</h3>\n<ul><li>We must <ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article" url="http://api.ft.com/content/3278e6dc-67af-11e7-9a66-93fb352ba1fe" title="www.ft.com">take back control</ft-content> over our private data, argues Sarah Gordon.</li>\n<li>The biggest challenge presented by Donald Trump is the <ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article" url="http://api.ft.com/content/5127c9e8-6b03-11e7-bfeb-33fe0c5b7eaa" title="www.ft.com">enfeebled country</ft-content> his election exposes — and that’s a bigger problem for the US itself than for the rest of the world. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class="ft-subhead">Numbers news</h3>\n<ul><li>US <ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article" url="http://api.ft.com/content/f691d448-e74b-3970-a944-48d5f5201de2" title="www.ft.com">financial conditions</ft-content> are the loosest in three years.<br/>\n<img src="http://www.ft.com/fastft/files/2017/07/finConditions-web.png" width="600"/>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>To receive Martin Sandbu’s <a href="http://www.ft.com/martin-sandbu-free-lunch" title="Martin Sandbu\'s Free Lunch">Free Lunch</a> by email every workday, <a href="http://nbe.ft.com/nbe/profile.cfm" title="nbe.ft.com">sign up here</a>\n</em>\n</p>\n</body>',

The squeeze on real incomes is continuing.</p><p>\n</p><p>Chris Giles goes through the various explanations for the slowdown in price growth, the most plausible being that June was just a blip before inflation accelerates again.</p><p>While we wait to find out, the Resolution Foundation has put its finger on an important fact that tends to be obscured by the overall inflation numbers published by the Office for National Statistics. This is because different types of households spend their money on different things, they also experience different inflation rates. The Resolution Foundation’s Stephen Clarke breaks down household spending by categories of expenditure and calculates that the poorest households have faced faster price growth for their typical consumption basket (2 per cent over the first six months of this year) than have the richest households (1.8 per cent).</p><p>This obviously affects the politics of inflation. And this has been a pattern for while. An ONS study of differential inflation experience for different types of households between 2003 and 2014 found that the “price of products purchased by households in the lowest expenditure decile increased on average by 3.7% per year over this period, compared with just 2.3% for the highest-expenditure decile”. Looking at income rather than expenditure yields equivalent conclusions.</p><p>Citing similar evidence that inflation fell more for the rich than for the poor in 2013-14, Clarke suggests that “even if inflation abates . . . it may not provide as much benefit for poorer households . . . This could mean that the current squeeze on living standards is longer and deeper than previously expected for lower income households.”</p><p>There are also clear differences in the <em>variability</em> of experienced inflation between different groups. That is documented in the ONS study for the UK. US data also exhibit such differences in volatility, which are found to correlate with different <em>expectations</em> of inflation from different demographic groups — even when, on the whole, those differences are not borne out by actual experienced inflation.</p><p>But expectations of inflation may matter as much as actually experienced inflation. That seems particularly important in countries where squeezed living standards have resulted in strong political insurgencies against the establishment. </p><p>The ONS study includes this tantalising paragraph: “Comparing the [overall consumer prices index] with the inflation outturns for different groups, this paper concludes that the CPI is broadly representative of the price experience of households around two-thirds of the way up the expenditure distribution. An equivalent, ‘democratic’ price index — which weights the inflation experience of households equally, rather than drawing on household sector expenditure weights — is around 0.3 percentage points higher on average than the plutocratic measure over this period.”</p><p>That is quite a distance between officially measured costs of living and how they are experienced by the majority of people. It almost invites an unscrupulous politician to complain about “fake numbers” in a “rigged system”.</p><h3 class="ft-subhead">Other readables</h3><ul><li>We must take back control over our private data, argues Sarah Gordon.</li>\n<li>The biggest challenge presented by Donald Trump is the enfeebled country his election exposes — and that’s a bigger problem for the US itself than for the rest of the world. </li>\n</ul><h3 class="ft-subhead">Numbers news</h3><ul><li>US financial conditions are the loosest in three years.<br/>\n\n</li>\n</ul><p><em>To receive Martin Sandbu’s Free Lunch by email every workday, sign up here\n</em>\n</p><footer>\n    <p>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017</p>\n    <p>© 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.

Although the BBC says pay is going down, is that pay being hidden?” said Damian Collins, chair of the parliamentary select committee for culture, media and sport.</p>\n<ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet" url="http://api.ft.com/content/f9fac8a4-6c75-11e7-218d-a464d62fd5e3" data-embedded="true"></ft-content>\n<p>The level of disclosure in next year’s list is likely to be scaled back because the broadcaster’s in-house production division, BBC Studios, will be spun out as a separate company. Presenters who appear on BBC shows produced by BBC Studios will not have to publish that element of their pay.</p>\n<p>Lord Hall said on Wednesday that the overall number of presenters earning more than £150,000 a year had fallen by 13 in the past year, and that the total bill for those earning over that threshold had fallen by £3.1m since last year, to £28.4m.</p>\n<p>He said he was “satisfied” with the list of people earning more than £150,000.</p>\n<p>There was awkwardness on display within the BBC throughout the day, as newsreaders and presenters had to interview their managers, and in some cases each other, about how much they earned, as the story dominated the corporation’s own news bulletins.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Vine, revealed to be paid more than £700,000, interviewed his boss James Purnell, asking how he “justified” paying him so much. “You’re a fantastic broadcaster,” Mr Purnell responded. </p>\n<ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet" url="http://api.ft.com/content/032a18ea-6c7a-11e7-218d-a464d62fd5e3" data-embedded="true"></ft-content>\n<p>Later in the day, another <em>Today</em> presenter John Humphrys was asked by the BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan if he was worth his £600,000 to £650,000 a year salary and whether he would take a £200,000 pay cut to continue working for the corporation.</p>\n<p>“Would I chop my salary in half? I don’t know, maybe I would,” said Mr Humphrys. “The BBC hasn’t suggested that.</p>\n<p>“I’ve no idea if I am worth that amount of public money. What do I do on paper . . . nothing justifies that amount of money. If a doctor saves a person’s life or a fireman rushes into Grenfell tower . . . compared with that sort of thing I am not worth tuppence ha’penny.”</p>\n<p>After the interview, Mr Humphreys admitted to the Financial Times that the whole day had been “totally surreal”. He won support from some people for daring to put himself up for a grilling, while other BBC presenters kept their heads down. </p>\n<p>Andrew Marr, meanwhile, was at pains to point out that while he earns “£400,475 a year”, his salary has been coming down. “I now earn £139k a year less than I did two years ago,” he said. </p>\n\n<ft-content type="http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet" url="http://api.ft.com/content/2f3aef44-6c71-11e7-27a1-8235aeffcb99" data-embedded="true"></ft-content>\n\n<p>The discrepancies between men and women working on the same programmes was widely noted. </p>\n<p>While Mr Humphrys received between £600,000 and £649,000 last year, Mishal Husain was paid less than half that amount.

There were only 34 women in total, reviving arguments about a lack of gender balance at the corporation. Only Ms Winkleman and <em>One Show</em> presenter Alex Jones were in the top 10 pay brackets.</p><p>“We’ve seen the way the BBC is paying women less for doing the same job,” the prime minister told LBC. “What’s important is that the BBC looks at the question of paying men and women the same for doing the same job.”</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------<br/>Full list<br/>\nHow much are the BBC’s top stars paid?\n<br/>----------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Broadcaster Jane Garvey tweeted: “I’m looking forward to presenting @BBCWomansHour today. We’ll be discussing #GenderPayGap. As we’ve done since 1946. Going well, isn’t it?”</p><p>Critics also pointed out that there was a pay gap between white presenters and those from minority ethnic backgrounds. The highest paid minority ethnic broadcasters were George Alagiah, Jason Mohammad and Trevor Nelson, each receiving between £250,000 and £300,000.</p><p>Tony Hall, BBC director-general, said the corporation was more diverse on gender and ethnic diversity than the civil service and other broadcasters.</p><p>He pointed to pay rises and promotions given to female presenters in the past four years, adding that of those promoted to jobs paying more than £150,000 since 2013, two-thirds were women, including the BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.</p><p>Asked whether he feared legal action from female presenters following the release of the pay list, Lord Hall would only say that it was his job to manage the relationship with top talent. “We’ve made progress, but we recognise there is more to do and we are pushing further and faster than any other broadcaster.”</p><p>The BBC was forced to disclose the salaries as part of its new royal charter agreement with the government.</p><br/><p>Under the agreement, salaries not funded directly by the licence fee, or those through independent production companies, are not included on the list. As a result, the salary of David Dimbleby, one of the best-known faces of the BBC, was not disclosed.</p><p>“This is something we need to look at. Although the BBC says pay is going down, is that pay being hidden?” said Damian Collins, chair of the parliamentary select committee for culture, media and sport.</p><p>The level of disclosure in next year’s list is likely to be scaled back because the broadcaster’s in-house production division, BBC Studios, will be spun out as a separate company. Presenters who appear on BBC shows produced by BBC Studios will not have to publish that element of their pay.</p><p>Lord Hall said on Wednesday that the overall number of presenters earning more than £150,000 a year had fallen by 13 in the past year, and that the total bill for those earning over that threshold had fallen by £3.1m since last year, to £28.4m.</p><p>He said he was “satisfied” with the list of people earning more than £150,000.</p><p>There was awkwardness on display within the BBC throughout the day, as newsreaders and presenters had to interview their managers, and in some cases each other, about how much they earned, as the story dominated the corporation’s own news bulletins.</p><p>Jeremy Vine, revealed to be paid more than £700,000, interviewed his boss James Purnell, asking how he “justified” paying him so much. “You’re a fantastic broadcaster,” Mr Purnell responded. </p><p>Later in the day, another <em>Today</em> presenter John Humphrys was asked by the BBC’s media editor Amol Rajan if he was worth his £600,000 to £650,000 a year salary and whether he would take a £200,000 pay cut to continue working for the corporation.</p><p>“Would I chop my salary in half? I don’t know, maybe I would,” said Mr Humphrys. “The BBC hasn’t suggested that.</p><p>“I’ve no idea if I am worth that amount of public money. What do I do on paper . . . nothing justifies that amount of money. If a doctor saves a person’s life or a fireman rushes into Grenfell tower . . . compared with that sort of thing I am not worth tuppence ha’penny.”</p><p>After the interview, Mr Humphreys admitted to the Financial Times that the whole day had been “totally surreal”. He won support from some people for daring to put himself up for a grilling, while other BBC presenters kept their heads down. </p><p>Andrew Marr, meanwhile, was at pains to point out that while he earns “£400,475 a year”, his salary has been coming down. “I now earn £139k a year less than I did two years ago,” he said. </p><p>The discrepancies between men and women working on the same programmes was widely noted. </p><p>While Mr Humphrys received between £600,000 and £649,000 last year, Mishal Husain was paid less than half that amount. Her colleague Sarah Montague’s pay was not disclosed because she did not break through the £150,000-a-year threshold, possibly because she worked fewer shifts. </p><p>The BBC said that making comparisons between presenters was “fraught with danger” because different people could be working different shift patterns, or doing extra work for other parts of the organisation. Mr Humphrys tops up his money from <em>Today</em> by fronting the quiz show <em>Mastermind</em>.</p><p>One BBC presenter told the Financial Times that there was anger inside the corporation following the list’s publication. “It’s very upsetting,” the presenter said. “What is the government’s intention here? To make it much more difficult for the BBC.”</p><p>Other senior journalists greeted the news with resignation, with one saying: “There were no great surprises here.”</p><table class="data-table"><caption>The BBC’s highest-paid stars</caption>\n<tr><td colspan="2"><p>Chris Evans, £2.2m-£2.25m</p>\n<p>Gary Lineker £1.75m-£1.8m</p>\n<p>Graham Norton £850,000-£900,000</p>\n<p>Jeremy Vine £700,000-£750,000</p>\n<p>John Humphrys £600,000-£650,000</p>\n<p>Huw Edwards £550,000-£600,000</p>\n<p>Steve Wright £500,000-£550,000</p>\n<p>Claudia Winkleman £450,000-£500,000 </p>\n<p>Matt Baker £450,000-£500,000</p>\n<p>Andrew Marr £400,000-£450,000 </p>\n<p>Alan Shearer £400,000-£450,000</p>\n<p>Alex Jones £400,000-£450,000 </p>\n<p>Nicky Campbell £400,000-£450,000</p>\n<p>Stephen Nolan £400,000-£450,000</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table><footer>\n    <p>Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017</p>\n    <p>© 2017 The Financial Times Ltd.
