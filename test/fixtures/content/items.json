        "bodyText": "The pound leapt above the $1.36 mark on Friday to its highest level since the Brexit vote, as a speech from a Bank of England policymaker hardened perceptions that the central bank is moving to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.\n\nGertjan Vlieghe, a member of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee who has previously been cautious about tightening policy, said “we are approaching the moment when the bank rate may need to rise”.\n\nComing a day after the MPC kept rates on hold but gave a heavy signal it is minded to lift the base rate from a record low, the speech added fuel to the pound’s rally.\n\nInvestors sold shorter dated government bonds, which are sensitive to changing expectations for the base rate, pushing the yield up 4 basis points to 0.42 per cent, after earlier hitting a session high above 0.48 per cent. That was the highest level since the week before the EU referendum in June last year.\n\nUK stocks were also hard hit by the sterling move, the FTSE 100 index sliding 1.1 per cent.\n\n“The BoE really have lined up the market for a hike,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.3589 after earlier hitting a day high of $1.3615 — this 1.4 per cent advance leaves sterling up about 3 per cent against the dollar on the week week, which began with stronger than expected inflation figures.\n\nThe currency also powered higher against the euro, rising 1.1 per cent and was trading at just under 88p versus the euro.\n\nAlthough the MPC voted 7-2 to hold rates yesterday, the commentary accompanying the decision — and Mr Vlieghe’s speech today — is convincing more investors that after talking about lifting rates earlier in the year, the MPC is now more serious about doing so.\n\n“The possibility of a November or February hike is real, we think,” analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted. “That said, we cannot understand why the BoE would want to hike rates just as currency effects on inflation are about to fade while domestic price pressure is non-existent. They seem to be panicking about the inflation peak rather than looking ahead to the likely sharp drop next year.”\n\nBefore Mr Vlieghe’s speech on Friday morning, currency analysts had thought the pound was heading to $1.35 sooner than expected, given the increasingly hawkish BoE slant and its concerns about rising inflation. Yet some have reservations about the shift from the bank.\n\nMr Vlieghe acknowledged that inflation may ease back, and that uncertainty over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations may have “a larger impact on the economy than we have seen so far”.\n\nDavid Meier, an economist at Julius Baer, said he was sceptical about the shift in BoE tone, saying it was “deliberately set to stabilise further the pound sterling”.\n\nThe currency’s weakness has been a strong driver of inflation and the pound’s renewed strength “will limit the inflation overshoot”.\n\nWhile strategists at Nomura now believe the BoE will raise rates in November, Mr Rochester said there remained “many doubters” in the market. But added that the notion the idea of the BoE turning hawkish to support the currency and rate markets was a conspiracy theory.\n\n“The BoE have had a continually evolving narrative towards hiking all year and now are at the brink of action,” said Mr Rochester.",

        "bodyText": "Cities and big tech companies usually do not get along very well. Just look at San Francisco or Seattle — many locals love nothing more than a good gripe against Google or Uber or Amazon.\n\nIt’s been curious, then, to watch cities rush forward after Amazon said it was looking for a site to build a second headquarters in North America. Mayors from Pittsburgh to Chicago to Memphis have jumped on Twitter and on the phone to woo Amazon, promising their constituents they will work hard to win the company’s favour.\n\nThe prize is certainly vast — Amazon has said it will spend at least $5bn to build the new headquarters, which will be home to some 50,000 employees.\n\nIn Seattle, Amazon’s hometown, however, the company’s presence is somewhat controversial. Any visitor is immediately struck by the scale of Amazon’s urban campus, some 33 buildings right in the heart of town. The buildings are not walled off, but there is a noticeable change in atmosphere as you enter Amazon-land: the sidewalks get cleaner, the people have fewer tattoos and fancy fitness studios become more frequent.\n\nAs the campus has ballooned from 20,000 people two years ago to more than 40,000 people today, its footprint has become a sore point. Many workers live nearby — one in five walks to work — heightening the sense that downtown Seattle has become a company town.\n\nSuddenly Seattle’s conversations about rent control, a practice long banned in Washington state, have become serious. Seattle even elected its first socialist city council member in many decades in 2014, who campaigned in part on concerns about affordable housing and gentrification. None of this used to happen in the city, long known as a low-tax, business-friendly jurisdiction. (Washington’s low taxes were a key reason why Jeff Bezos set up shop there all those years ago.)\n\nAmazon has not been totally blind to these concerns. As if to mute its presence, the company has avoided any big “Amazon” signs on building exteriors. It is also creating a botanical garden in the centre of Seattle, housed in three greenhouse spheres — although these will not be fully open to the public. Instead they will be used mostly for corporate meetings.\n\nA similar frisson with big tech has long been felt in San Francisco, where locals harbour deep resentment for the hordes of tech workers that have flooded the city. For years, irritated San Franciscans staged protests at the bus stops where Google’s fleet of big white commuter buses picked up city-dwelling tech workers with their lattes and even their dogs, to ferry them to company headquarters in Silicon Valley. These protests have died down recently, partly because soaring rents in the city have priced out many former and would-be protesters.\n\nThe dispute between cities and the tech corporations boils down to the question of what it means for companies to be good corporate citizens. The inefficiencies of government mean that cities are often unable to cope with rapid change, even while an increased tax base may help fill city coffers. Companies must then try to fill in infrastructure gaps themselves, but often these efforts draw the ire of the public, which perceives them as only benefiting the corporations and their staff.\n\nWhile big tech companies are trying to manage the backlash from the cities they inhabit, a growing number of start-ups are trying to design tech-utopian cities of the future. These groups are working on 3D-printed buildings, trains that move at close to the speed of sound and new systems of banking and taxation that could replace the role of government as we know it.\n\nThe concept of a “city in a box” is often tossed around, as if these urban visions will spring forth fully formed once the technology is perfected. But before they invent the cities of the future, tech companies must first learn how to live within the cities of today.\n\nLeslie Hook is the FT’s San Francisco correspondent\n\nIllustration by Christopher de Lorenzo",

        "bodyHTML": "<p>The British political season is almost upon us. And many people are asking, might Theresa May face a leadership challenge. And what about the leadership qualities of Jeremy Corbyn newly rejuvenated? What is the ultimate test of leadership? Is it authenticity? Here with me to discuss this is Janan Ganesh and you made a quite extraordinary attack this week on authenticity and a putative challenger to Mrs. May, Jacob Rees-Mogg. </p><p>Yeah, authenticity has become the gold dust when looking for political candidates in the modern world. Jeremy Corbyn is seen to have done well as labour leader because he has authenticity. Boris Johnson for a long time looked like a plausible prime minister because people said, well, he's authentic. He's unspun. But I think him Jacob Rees-Mogg you have an example of someone who's clearly authentic, doesn't disguise the fact that he's a very privileged man, and doesn't disguise the fact that he's-- </p><p>Some of the times editor. </p><p>Former newspaper editor. </p><p>William Rees-Mogg. </p><p>But doesn't also disguise the fact that he's a committed Catholic. And he expressed views on abortion and same-sex marriage that annoyed a lot of people who were big fans of him only two weeks ago. And that's an example of the fact that when people say they want authenticity, what they mean is the kind of authenticity they like. </p><p>Yeah but-- </p><p>There's good authenticity and then there's the bad stuff, which they suddenly go cold over. </p><p>Yeah, but Janan, I mean, we watched the British election campaign earlier this year in which Theresa May, for all her qualities, was incapable of spontaneous talking, speaking on the trail. And she wasn't authentic. </p><p>She could argue that that was the authentic her, that she's not a natural public performer. She's not a natural people person. Actually she's a diligent, behind-the-scenes kind of politician who works through a brief and does her best in that way, rather than a spectacular personality. But that's fine. The problem I have with the authenticity cult is that people think it's somehow enough. That if someone is expressive of views that are unusual, doesn't employ a media adviser, it's very direct-- </p><p>That's the point about media advisers. I mean, you know, I've covered American presidential campaigns. I mean, they're all over the place. You get the blow dried hair cut candidate. </p><p>Yeah. </p><p>And he's totally scripted or she's totally scripted. Look at Hillary Clinton last year. </p><p>And that's annoying to a lot of people and hard to connect with. But in office, is it enough to say, well, I'm authentic and, therefore, I should be national leader of a country of 60 million people with nuclear weapons and a very large economy. I think authenticity is not even necessary, let alone sufficient. And we started to talk about it as though it was almost a sufficient criterion on which to elect a national leader. </p><p>Well, I'm coming round to your point of view. But what about Jeremy Corbyn?

        "bodyText": "The British political season is almost upon us. And many people are asking, might Theresa May face a leadership challenge. And what about the leadership qualities of Jeremy Corbyn newly rejuvenated? What is the ultimate test of leadership? Is it authenticity? Here with me to discuss this is Janan Ganesh and you made a quite extraordinary attack this week on authenticity and a putative challenger to Mrs. May, Jacob Rees-Mogg.\n\nYeah, authenticity has become the gold dust when looking for political candidates in the modern world. Jeremy Corbyn is seen to have done well as labour leader because he has authenticity. Boris Johnson for a long time looked like a plausible prime minister because people said, well, he's authentic. He's unspun. But I think him Jacob Rees-Mogg you have an example of someone who's clearly authentic, doesn't disguise the fact that he's a very privileged man, and doesn't disguise the fact that he's--\n\nSome of the times editor.\n\nFormer newspaper editor.\n\nWilliam Rees-Mogg.\n\nBut doesn't also disguise the fact that he's a committed Catholic. And he expressed views on abortion and same-sex marriage that annoyed a lot of people who were big fans of him only two weeks ago. And that's an example of the fact that when people say they want authenticity, what they mean is the kind of authenticity they like.\n\nYeah but--\n\nThere's good authenticity and then there's the bad stuff, which they suddenly go cold over.\n\nYeah, but Janan, I mean, we watched the British election campaign earlier this year in which Theresa May, for all her qualities, was incapable of spontaneous talking, speaking on the trail. And she wasn't authentic.\n\nShe could argue that that was the authentic her, that she's not a natural public performer. She's not a natural people person. Actually she's a diligent, behind-the-scenes kind of politician who works through a brief and does her best in that way, rather than a spectacular personality. But that's fine. The problem I have with the authenticity cult is that people think it's somehow enough. That if someone is expressive of views that are unusual, doesn't employ a media adviser, it's very direct--\n\nThat's the point about media advisers. I mean, you know, I've covered American presidential campaigns. I mean, they're all over the place. You get the blow dried hair cut candidate.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd he's totally scripted or she's totally scripted. Look at Hillary Clinton last year.\n\nAnd that's annoying to a lot of people and hard to connect with. But in office, is it enough to say, well, I'm authentic and, therefore, I should be national leader of a country of 60 million people with nuclear weapons and a very large economy. I think authenticity is not even necessary, let alone sufficient. And we started to talk about it as though it was almost a sufficient criterion on which to elect a national leader.\n\nWell, I'm coming round to your point of view. But what about Jeremy Corbyn? I mean, isn't he authentic? I mean, the flat cap, the beard has been trimmed now, of course.\n\nA bit, yeah.\n\nBut you know, he is what he looks like, which is a 1970s style socialist.\n\nCompletely, I think he's entirely authentic. Hasn't changed his views since he entered parliament in the early 1980s, completely unspun, slight trimming of the beard. I think he started to wear a suit now, or at least a jacket and tie but nothing artificial really. But is that a sufficient criterion on which to elect a national leader? And my only--\n\nSo what are the qualities that we need? And if we're going to put authenticity slightly to the side, not completely--\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat are we looking at?\n\nI think that-- I still think a good national leader will, to a large extent, be inauthentic. And we will find them objectionable in many ways. And so someone like a Tony Blair or a John Major was seen to be sometimes underhand to not say the entirety of what they mean. And that's necessary. You're having to balance interests within your cabinet. You're having to balance principle with practical reality. You're having to set this interest group up against that one and somehow keep some semblance of popularity while governing the country.\n\nYou can only do that as a national leader if you are a little bit sly, a little bit inauthentic, and are willing to not say absolutely everything you mean at any given time. So I think it's almost kind of weirdly juvenile demand that we, as the media, and to a certain extent the electorate have come up with in expecting everyone to be completely honest and authentic all the time.\n\nSo I'm writing down Jacob Rees-Mogg's chances of being the next Conservative Party leader. Thank you Janan Ganesh.\n\nThank you.",
