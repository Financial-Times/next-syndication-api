  "bodyText": "The pound leapt above the $1.36 mark on Friday to its highest level since the Brexit vote, as a speech from a Bank of England policymaker hardened perceptions that the central bank is moving to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.\n\nGertjan Vlieghe, a member of the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee who has previously been cautious about tightening policy, said “we are approaching the moment when the bank rate may need to rise”.\n\nComing a day after the MPC kept rates on hold but gave a heavy signal it is minded to lift the base rate from a record low, the speech added fuel to the pound’s rally.\n\nInvestors sold shorter dated government bonds, which are sensitive to changing expectations for the base rate, pushing the yield up 4 basis points to 0.42 per cent, after earlier hitting a session high above 0.48 per cent. That was the highest level since the week before the EU referendum in June last year.\n\nUK stocks were also hard hit by the sterling move, the FTSE 100 index sliding 1.1 per cent.\n\n“The BoE really have lined up the market for a hike,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura.\n\nSterling was last trading at $1.3589 after earlier hitting a day high of $1.3615 — this 1.4 per cent advance leaves sterling up about 3 per cent against the dollar on the week week, which began with stronger than expected inflation figures.\n\nThe currency also powered higher against the euro, rising 1.1 per cent and was trading at just under 88p versus the euro.\n\nAlthough the MPC voted 7-2 to hold rates yesterday, the commentary accompanying the decision — and Mr Vlieghe’s speech today — is convincing more investors that after talking about lifting rates earlier in the year, the MPC is now more serious about doing so.\n\n“The possibility of a November or February hike is real, we think,” analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch noted. “That said, we cannot understand why the BoE would want to hike rates just as currency effects on inflation are about to fade while domestic price pressure is non-existent. They seem to be panicking about the inflation peak rather than looking ahead to the likely sharp drop next year.”\n\nBefore Mr Vlieghe’s speech on Friday morning, currency analysts had thought the pound was heading to $1.35 sooner than expected, given the increasingly hawkish BoE slant and its concerns about rising inflation. Yet some have reservations about the shift from the bank.\n\nMr Vlieghe acknowledged that inflation may ease back, and that uncertainty over the outcome of the Brexit negotiations may have “a larger impact on the economy than we have seen so far”.\n\nDavid Meier, an economist at Julius Baer, said he was sceptical about the shift in BoE tone, saying it was “deliberately set to stabilise further the pound sterling”.\n\nThe currency’s weakness has been a strong driver of inflation and the pound’s renewed strength “will limit the inflation overshoot”.\n\nWhile strategists at Nomura now believe the BoE will raise rates in November, Mr Rochester said there remained “many doubters” in the market. But added that the notion the idea of the BoE turning hawkish to support the currency and rate markets was a conspiracy theory.\n\n“The BoE have had a continually evolving narrative towards hiking all year and now are at the brink of action,” said Mr Rochester.",
