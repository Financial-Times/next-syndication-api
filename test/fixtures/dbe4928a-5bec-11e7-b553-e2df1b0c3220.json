Manslaughter can only be proved for those who die within a year and a day.</p>\n<p>As well as Mr Duckenfield, Norman Bettison, who went on to be chief constable of the Merseyside and the West Yorkshire police forces, and two other retired officers, will go on trial.</p>\n<p>Sue Hemming, the CPS head of the special crime and counter terrorism division, said on Wednesday that the six, who also include Sheffield Wednesday’s company secretary at the time and a solicitor, were charged with criminal offences. It had considered 23 suspects in all.</p>\n<p>“We will allege that David Duckenfield’s failures to discharge his personal responsibility were extraordinarily bad and contributed substantially to the deaths of each of those 96 people who so tragically and unnecessarily lost their lives,” she said.</p>\n<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/1141d532-5c01-11e7-2b35-7545c1789969\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content>\n<p>The police had blamed drunken fans for storming a gate and cramming into fenced pens on the terraces at Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. In fact, the ground had no safety certificate and negligent policing may have contributed to the deaths.</p>\n<p>The FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April 15 1989 remains Britain’s worst sporting disaster.</p>\n<p>An inquest at the time was very limited in scope. A subsequent inquiry by a senior judge, Lord Justice Taylor, which was published in 1990, pointed to problems with stadium layout and policing but his conclusions were overtaken by a narrative that fans were to blame.</p>\n<p>Mr Duckenfield had ordered an exit gate to be opened to relieve congestion at the turnstiles, allowing about 2,000 fans into already overcrowded pens. </p>\n<p>After the 2016 inquest, the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the police’s Operation Resolve referred 23 suspects to the CPS. </p>\n<p>\n<a data-asset-type=\"video\" data-embedded=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhoMJtHslfk\"></a>\n</p>\n<p>Sir Norman, who was an inspector in the South Yorkshire police at the time, has been charged with four offences of misconduct in public office relating to alleged lies about his involvement in the aftermath of the disaster and the culpability of fans.</p>\n<p>He said he was “disappointed to be charged” and will “vigorously defend” his innocence.</p>\n<p>The others face more minor offences. All the defendants, except Mr Duckenfield, will appear at Warrington magistrates’ court on August 8.</p>\n<p>Two West Midlands police officers are still under investigation, with no charging decision made.</p>\n<p>The victims’ families said they felt vindicated. Barry Devonside, whose 18-year-old son Chris died in the disaster, said the families applauded when the charges were read out. “We have got everything we could have asked for. It is right and proper that we fought for our loved ones.” </p>\n<p>Ms Hemming gave comprehensive reasons for failing to act against the institutions involved. Sheffield Wednesday, currently a championship club, is a new entity with no connection with its 1989 predecessor. The slow response by the South Yorkshire Ambulance Service was because of planning failures rather than individual actions on the day. </p>\n<p>There was not enough evidence that the Football Association, which chose the venue, was responsible for any breach of a safety certificate, she said. </p>\n<p>Prosecutors had to weigh 61,000 pages of evidence from the IPCC and 85,000 pages from the police. </p><table class=\"data-table\"><caption>The six who have been charged</caption>\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>● David Duckenfield, 72, of South Yorkshire Police, was taking charge of his first football match on the day of the disaster. He was suspended from duty in August 1989 after the interim Taylor Report, and retired on medical grounds two years later, moving to rural Dorset. He apologised at last year’s inquest.</p>\n<p>● Norman Bettison, 61, was an inspector with South Yorkshire police at the time. In 1998 he was appointed chief constable of Merseyside, sparking outrage among the families and some councillors. He retired in 2012 as chief constable of West Yorkshire police. He is charged with four offences of misconduct in public office relating to lies he allegedly told. He has denied wrongdoing.</p>\n<p>● Graham Henry Mackrell, 67, was Sheffield Wednesday’s company secretary and safety officer at the time of the disaster. He went to work for other clubs including West Ham. He is on the board of the League Managers Association. He also assesses referees as a Premier League match delegate. He is charged with two offences of contravening a term of condition of a safety certificate, contrary to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and one offence of failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of other persons.</p>\n<p>● Peter Metcalf, 67, is a solicitor who acted for South Yorkshire police during the first inquest and the Taylor Inquiry at the request of insurers Municipal Mutual. He vetted statements by officers. He now has his own practice in Ilkley, West Yorkshire. He is charged with intent to pervert the course of public justice.</p>\n<p>● Donald Denton, 79, is a retired chief superintendent of South Yorkshire Police. He allegedly oversaw the process of amending the statements and is charged with intent to pervert the course of public justice.</p>\n<p>● Alan Foster, 76, is a retired detective chief inspector of South Yorkshire police, who allegedly changed statements. He is charged with intent to pervert the course of public justice.</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</body>",
