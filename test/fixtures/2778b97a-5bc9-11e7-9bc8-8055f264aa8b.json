But even the power of Brussels cannot turn the clock back a decade on the consumer internet.</p>\n<p>Foundem — the tiny UK shopping service that was the first to lodge a formal antitrust complaint against Google in Brussels, leading to this week’s <ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/9554a8bc-5b12-11e7-b553-e2df1b0c3220\">record €2.4bn fine </ft-content>against the company — has mothballed its online service. Visitors are informed that, because of the way Google unfairly penalises the company in its search results, “few visitors reach Foundem to witness how it has become a pale shadow of its former self”.</p>\n<p>Other companies involved in online comparison shopping, the service that was the focus of the commission’s case, have seen much of their business wiped out. Richard Stables, chief executive of Kelkoo, said this week that his company had missed out on “10 years of development and growth”. The revenues Kelkoo generates from visitors referred by search engines have all but disappeared since 2010, falling from $12m to $200,000.</p>\n<p>Pursuing private lawsuits against Google, which had been put on hold pending the EU decision, may now be the best business model open to such companies. “The amount of damages that is going to come against Google is going to be much, much higher than what the EU Commission fined them today,” said Mr Stables.</p>\n<p>Google, not surprisingly, has had a different slant on events. Many comparative shopping sites have simply been rendered redundant by the evolution of online shopping and changing consumer expectations, said Kent Walker, the search company’s general counsel, in a <a href=\"https://www.blog.google/topics/google-europe/european-commission-decision-shopping-google-story/\">blog post </a>on Tuesday.</p>\n<p>Whichever version of events is closer to the truth, the action in Brussels, which came eight years after Foundem first brought its complaint, does not seem likely to make much difference to the way consumers carry out online research into products they are thinking of buying.</p>\n<p>“It’s way too late to save competition in comparison shopping,” said Gary Reback, a US lawyer who has represented a number of US companies in the field. “The companies Google has run out of business aren’t coming back.”</p>\n<p>--------------------</p>\n<p><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/41248fa4-5b22-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b\" title=\"www.ft.com\">FT View: Case shows how Europe is still playing catch-up</ft-content> <br/>\n<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/3e5f330e-5b1e-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b\" title=\"www.ft.com\">What the EU’s antitrust fine means for Google</ft-content> <br/>\n<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/b595e54e-5b50-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b\" title=\"www.ft.com\">EU prises open Google’s search engine</ft-content>\n</p>\n<p>--------------------</p>\n<p>However, the commission’s intervention could still ricochet through other corners of the <ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/b595e54e-5b50-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b\" title=\"www.ft.com\">search business</ft-content>. In announcing the expected fine on Tuesday, Margrethe Vestager, the EU’s competition commissioner, delivered what Google’s rivals had been hoping for: a broad statement of principle that could limit the search company’s power in other markets.</p>\n<p>In future, she said, Google will be required to give rivals “equal treatment” — the same as its own services in its search results. That requirement could be used to limit Google’s ability to promote its own services in other specialised, or “vertical”, parts of the search market, including travel and local advertising.</p>\n<p>“The commission seems to be signalling that this is the first domino to fall, and other verticals may be on the way,” said Luther Lowe, head of public policy at Yelp, the US local recommendations service. The EU’s ruling could also encourage other regulators around the world to take action, he said.</p>\n<pull-quote><pull-quote-text><p>The commission seems to be signalling that this is the first domino to fall, and other verticals may be on the way</p></pull-quote-text><pull-quote-source>Luther Lowe, head of public policy at Yelp</pull-quote-source></pull-quote>\n<p>One question now is how the search company itself responds to this week’s EU action. It could try to stall, filing a legal challenge that would suspend any action pending a future legal appeal. That could put off a final conclusion for years.</p>\n<p>But that would put the company at loggerheads with the commission at a time when it badly needs to repair relations in Brussels, one rival points out. With the commission working on two other antitrust cases against the company, involving Android and Google’s advertising service, this would be a bad time to make enemies.</p>\n<p>Striking a more conciliatory stance, for instance by bowing to and offering more concessions to the comparative shopping sites, would reduce this risk. But it could also open the door sooner for others to capitalise on this week’s ruling.</p>\n<p>Companies in other specialist search markets have already been lining up to push their cases. Complaints lodged with the commission during its eight-year review included local search, maps, travel and news aggregation. The commission put those to one side as it focused on comparative shopping, but the companies argue that they have already gone a long way towards making their case.</p>\n<p>“We have done our homework — our members have been providing evidence [to the commission] over the past five years,” said Christoph Klenner, head of the ETTSA, a European trade group for online travel companies.</p>\n<p>Yet the need to build a watertight legal case is still likely to make Brussels cautious about rushing to extend its ruling to new markets. Ms Vestager was at pains this week to point out the exhaustive investigation her department had carried out into comparison shopping, including gathering data on the equivalent of 1.7bn search queries, before reaching its conclusion.</p>\n<p>According to internet search experts, meanwhile, markets such as local search advertising have already tipped in favour of Google, leaving rival internet giants such as Facebook and Amazon as the only likely challengers. </p>\n<p>“The [local search] market has coalesced around Google — the question is whether Facebook steps up to be a full-on competitor,” said Greg Sterling, head of strategy at the Local Search Association. “There’s a sense that Google and Facebook have too much power and control, and everyone else is being squeezed.”</p>\n<ft-related url=\"https://www.acast.com/ft-news/googlefinedrecord-2.4bnoverabuseofsearchdominance?autoplay\"><title>Podcast</title><headline>Google fined €2.4bn over search dominance\n</headline><media><ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/ImageSet\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/ccfdf12a-8727-11e6-393c-9bd714779197\" data-embedded=\"true\"></ft-content></media><intro><p>The EU has acted tough on the tech group for breaching competition rules</p></intro></ft-related>\n<p>One market where Google has yet to use its search dominance to build a clear lead involves online travel. But applying the findings in the comparative shopping case to the company’s hotel and flight search services will not be straightforward.</p>\n<p>Before deciding whether to take up new cases against Google, Brussels will look at “the characteristics of each market and the facts in a specific case”, said Ms Vestager. The way Google’s travel services operate shows just how different these can be.</p>\n<p>Its hotel finder, for instance, relies on online travel agents such as Expedia and TripAdvisor competing to supply listings. Its flight search, on the other hand, depends on information supplied directly by airlines, shutting out the agents, while giving the airlines a new channel to sell directly to consumers.</p>\n<p>Differences like these mean there is no guarantee that the findings in the comparative shopping case will be applicable to other corners of search. But with this week’s ruling, Google’s rivals have at least been given an opening to make their case.</p>\n\n<table class=\"data-table\"><caption>After shopping, Brussels probes ads and Android</caption>\n<tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Brussels broke a record in antitrust enforcement this week with a<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/fb3a6be4-a1cc-11e6-aa83-bcb58d1d2193\" title=\"Google launches counteroffensive in battle with EU - FT.com\"> €2.42bn fine</ft-content> after its<ft-content type=\"http://www.ft.com/ontology/content/Article\" url=\"http://api.ft.com/content/3e5f330e-5b1e-11e7-9bc8-8055f264aa8b\" title=\"What the EU’s €2.4bn antitrust fine means for Google - FT.com\"> investigation into Google Shopping</ft-content>.
