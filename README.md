The API behind the new FT.com/republishing tool.

## What is Syndication and how does it work

For an explanation, including a Slides deck which explains the infrastructure, please see [the Wiki page](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next/wiki/Syndication)

## Installation

```shell

    ~$ git clone git@github.com:Financial-Times/next-syndication-api.git

    ~$ cd next-syndication-api

    ~$ make install
    
    ~$ make .env

```

## Deployment

**Important!**

Syndication deviates from our standard deployment process please refer to the steps detailed [Deploying the download server](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-dl#deploying-the-download-server) if you are making a release on this app.

---

## Salesforce dependency

If you need to test a specific contract, since all contracts live in the production salesforce environment, in order to test certain contracts locally you will need to use the production `SALESFORCE_*` environment variables rather than the development ones (see Vault).

In development mode you should be using the FT Staff contract, which is stubbed in `stubs/CA-00001558.json`


### Setting yourself up on a contract

In order to see the syndication icons, you need to belong to a licence with a syndication contract. Email customer support at `help@ft.com` and ask to be added to a staff syndication licence.

---
## Run locally

You WILL need:
* [next-syndication-db-schema](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-db-schema) - database schema (see Database dependency below)

You MIGHT need:
* [next-syn-list](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syn-list) - front-end app for syndication customers. If you want to work on the pages that users see when they go to `/republishing` you will need this.
* [n-syndication](https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-syndication) - client-side library for syndication icons and overlays which you can `bower link` to an app (e.g. next-front-page) for local development.
* [next-syndication-dl](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-dl) - downloads app, you are less likely to need to work on this though.

### Database dependency

If you need to use the database locally, set up the database by following the instructions in [next-syndication-db-schema](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-db-schema).

If you are using postgres in Docker, you will need to edit your `.env` file to set `DATABASE_HOST` to `192.168.99.100`

### Running
Once you have set up the projects you want to work on, and want to run all projects easily, you can do so from within the `next-syndication-api`, you will need to:

- update your local [next-router](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-router)'s `.env` file to include the following:

  ```properties

     syndication-api=3255
     syn-contract=3984
     syn-list=3566

  ```
- This API doesn't run the router, so you will need to start that manually with `cd` into `next-router` and `make run-https` unless you are also running another app like next-syn-list
- `cd` into `next-syndication-api` and `make run-local`
- go to `http://local.ft.com:3255/__gtg`to confirm the syndication API app is responding


- `cd` into `next-syn-list` and run `make run`
- go to [https://local.ft.com:5050/syndication/user-status](https://local.ft.com:5050/syndication/user-status) to confirm everything is working

This will start the `next-syndication-api` the associated worker processes and the republishing contract and history pages using [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) and tail the logs for all HTTP servers/processes.

You can also run `make run-monit` to bring up the [PM2 process monitor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2#cpu--memory-monitoring).

Once you have stopped the app running, you will need to run `make stop-local` to stop all the clusters running too.

## Configuration

This project and the [next-syndication-dL](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-dl) project both use standard next environment variables for storing secrets in vault.

Though a lot of config for these projects is not secret, so rather than pollute vault with generic configuration, a layer has been added on top of the standard environment variables.

Both projects use a library called [config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/config) for which you define a `config/default.yaml` file which can be overlaid by other config files based on naming conventions like `config/${NODE_ENV}.yaml` and/or `config/${require('os').hostname()}.yaml` see the [config module documentation for File Load Order](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Configuration-Files#file-load-order) for more information.

All secrets are added to the [generic config](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-api/tree/master/config) using the [Custom Environment Variables](https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config/wiki/Environment-Variables#custom-environment-variables) feature provided by the config library, so as to keep in line with `next`'s architecture and maintain no leaking of secrets throughout environments.

#### next-syndication-dl

You will notice that [next-syndication-dl](https://github.com/Financial-Times/next-syndication-dl) does not have its own `config` directory.

Don't worry, this is by design: the `config` directory and the `pandoc-dpkg` directories are both symlinked to the root of the project by the `make install` task.

### pandoc-dpkg ... or What the hell is this?

[pandoc](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) is the command line program that we use to turn our article from HTML into either plain text (`.txt`) or an open office document (`.docx`).

Considering its small file size: including the program as part of the project was much simpler than having to go through the rigmarole of trying to automate deployments of a heroku app with a custom add-on.

The original proof of concept version of the `next-syndication-api` used a separate stand-alone heroku app with the `pandoc` add-on.

While there is nothing wrong with this approach, it makes things less confusing and more "performant" now that we can run the program on each dyno running the `next-syndication-api`; rather than a single dyno running any and all calls to the `pandoc` program.

### Emails

Emails are sent by the `db-persist` worker using nodemailer and gmail.

If you are getting an `ETIMEDOUT` errors, this is probably because the connection is being blocked by the FT firewall.

You can test this by running (from terminal):

```shell

    ~$ openssl s_client -crlf -connect smtp.gmail.com:465

```

The last line of your out put should look something like this:

```shell

    220 smtp.gmail.com ESMTP q4sm4655414wmd.3 - gsmtp

```

If the last line of your output looks more like this:


```shell

    connect: Operation timed out
    connect:errno=60

```

Then you can't connect to the mail server.

Try turning wifi off on your phone to tether your computer to your phone's 4G connection and you should find it now works.


## Maintenance mode

To turn maintenance mode on, simply turn the `syndicationMaintenance` flag on for everyone.

Conversely, turn it off again to turn maintenance mode off.

## Shell script
There was a [shell script](https://github.com/constantology/n-dev-mode/blob/master/project/syndication) but this is out of date and not maintained

## canBeSyndicated

Articles acquired from CAPI (Content API) or Elasticsearch contain the property `canBeSyndicated`. Its value will be one of the following:

- `yes`: Yes, the article can be republished by a syndication subscriber.
- `no`: No, the article cannot be republished by a syndication subscriber (or indeed anyone).
- `withContributorPayment`: The article can be republished subject to payment and certain terms in the syndication subscriber's contract.
- `verify`: The article can potentially be republished, depending on certain factors, e.g. the syndication subscriber's account being part of a B2B contract which has a wider deal that grants syndication rights; agreement with the author to allow syndication of their work.

The response the API provides for the same article can vary depending on the specific account (enabling the front-end to display an account-specific permission status icon), e.g. an article with `canBeSyndicated: verify` would respond accordingly:

- FT (syndication subscriber) account: `messageCode: 'MSG_2200'` (i.e. requires enquiry with FT for details of syndication rights).
- Account of company that has a deal in place to republish the article: `messageCode: 'MSG_2100'` (i.e. article can be downloaded for republishing).

N.B. To be a syndication subscriber requires having `S1` in your [products list](https://session-next.ft.com/products), which should be the default case for all FT developer accounts, but if not then contact syndhelp@ft.com.

## Dealing with `no pg_hba.conf entry` - `Syndication database data integrity` errors
Turns out that our Database Integrity healthcheck (db-sync-state) runs against review branches, as well as production. The `DATABASE_URL` secret is not stored in vault; it automatically added by the Postgres add-on. However, this secret is only added to the `prod` app's secrets. If you encounter this error, this is most likely the database secrets were updated. To fix this, you need to get the `DATABASE_URL` secret from the `prod` app, and add it to the review apps' secrets. To do this, go to Heroku's next-syndication-api main pipeline page, click "Configure" in the `Review Apps` column, then select `More settings`. In the `Settings` page, scroll down to `Reveal Config Vars`, reveal the vars and add the `DATABASE_URL` secret
